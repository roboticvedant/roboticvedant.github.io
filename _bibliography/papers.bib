  abstract  = "Abstract With advances in materials and manufacturing
               techniques, recent years have seen a number of conductive
               composite materials that exhibit pronounced strain-dependent
               electrical resistivity, allowing them to be used for embedded,
               cost-effective strain sensing in various applications. The
               strain-resistivity relationship of these materials, however, is
               often highly nonlinear and dynamic, posing challenges for
               effective use of such strain sensors. In this paper, a
               computationally efficient scheme is proposed for compensating
               the nonlinear, dynamic strain-resistance behavior of a soft
               conductive rubber using a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN). The
               accuracy and feasibility of the technique is evaluated with a
               soft robotic arm incorporating three strain sensors for
               proprioception. Experimental results show that the sensing
               scheme is able to predict both the tip position and the shape of
               the robotic manipulator, achieving an average tip positional
               error of less than 4\% relative to the total length of the
               manipulator.",
