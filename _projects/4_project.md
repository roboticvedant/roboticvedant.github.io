### Project Summary  
This project tackles a fundamental challenge in soft robotics â€” the nonlinear and time-dependent response of stretchable strain sensors. We developed a lightweight compensation model using **Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs)** to correct for **hysteresis and dynamic lag** in conductive rubber-based sensors.

The approach was applied to a soft continuum manipulator, enabling real-time **proprioceptive sensing** with high spatial accuracy. The compensated output achieved a **mean tip position error under 4%** of the manipulatorâ€™s total length â€” demonstrating strong promise for closed-loop control applications.
