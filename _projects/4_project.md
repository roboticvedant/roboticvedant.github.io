This project addresses the challenges in soft robotics sensing by developing a computationally efficient compensation scheme for nonlinear, dynamic strain-resistance behavior in soft conductive rubber sensors. Using Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN), we achieved accurate proprioceptive sensing in a soft robotic arm with an average tip positional error of less than 4% relative to the total length of the manipulator.
