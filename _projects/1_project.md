### Principal Investigator  
**Dr. Xiaobo Tan**

### Project Overview  
The **Autonomous Blimp Robot** project at the Smart Microsystems Lab involves the development of a fully integrated indoor aerial platform. The blimp is designed to be low-noise, safe, and highly maneuverable ‚Äî ideal for real-time control research and soft robotic exploration.

**Highlights of the project:**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Hardware Development**  
  Designed and manufactured a modular robotic blimp platform, equipped with vectored thrust actuation and onboard sensing.

- ü§ñ **ROS2 Integration**  
  Developed the firmware to interface with micro-ros,and connect the blimp platform with **ROS2**, enabling real-time communication, visualization, and control. Making it modular to prototype and use high level control and localization stacks.

- üß† **Dynamics Modeling & Simulation**  
  Derived full **6DOF nonlinear dynamics** using Euler‚ÄìLagrange formalism and implemented a physics-based simulator to validate control algorithms in silico.

### Motivation  
Autonomous blimps present a compelling solution for long-duration aerial tasks in domains such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. Their inherently low-power, buoyancy-assisted design enables extended flight times, making them ideal for missions where coverage, persistence, and minimal disturbance are prioritized over agility.

They are particularly well-suited for:

> üåæ Precision agriculture ‚Äî monitoring crop health, irrigation zones, or soil conditions across large farmlands with minimal ground intervention.

> üåç Environmental sensing ‚Äî collecting atmospheric, air quality, or thermal data over extended periods and wide geographic areas.

> üîã Energy-efficient aerial surveillance ‚Äî performing long-term monitoring tasks with reduced actuation demands compared to rotorcraft.

> üõ∞Ô∏è Autonomous navigation in GPS-degraded environments ‚Äî such as under tree canopies, near tall crops, or in remote, signal-poor areas.
