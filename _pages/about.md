I am an undergraduate student at Michigan State University, majoring in Electrical Engineering with a focus on robotics, embedded systems, and control systems. My passion lies in developing autonomous robots and intelligent systems that can make a meaningful impact in the real world.

## Research Interests

My research interests span across several exciting areas:
- **Embedded Systems & Robotics**: Developing firmware for autonomous systems and working with various microcontroller platforms
- **Control Systems**: Implementing advanced control algorithms for robotic applications
- **Machine Learning**: Applying reinforcement learning and neural networks to real-world engineering problems

## Current Work

I'm currently involved in several cutting-edge projects:

- Research Assistant at **PoliMOVE-MSU Autonomous Racing Team**, where I'm developing reinforcement learning-based vehicle controllers for IndyCar racing
- Undergraduate Research Assistant at **Smart Microsystems Lab**, working on autonomous robotic systems and advanced sensing technologies
- Electric Propulsion Lead at **MSU Solar Racing Team**, where I lead the motor and motor controller integration

## Technical Background

I have extensive experience in:
- PCB design and firmware development using Altium Designer and Xilinx SDK
- Programming in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB
- Robotics frameworks including ROS 2 and micro-ROS
- Machine learning tools like TensorFlow and OpenCV

My work combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, always aiming to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.
