      institution: PoliMOVE-MSU Autonomous Racing Team, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, US
      year: Oct24-Feb25
      description:
        - Was working on developing a LiDAR-based opponent detection system for the Polimove-MSU Autonomous Racing Team, leveraging the PointPillars architecture to enhance real-time object detection and tracking at speeds up to 180 mph. This involves conditioning and structuring raw LiDAR data to optimize the 3D voxel grid, enabling efficient feature extraction and improving model inference times.
        - To complement this, I engineered an approach to generate ground truth data from the the race car dataset. This method involved conditioning the raw sensor data, pre-processing it to remove noise, and aligning it with annotated labels for high-fidelity training sets. This tailored approach ensures that the detection model is robust against varied race track environments and scenarios, leading to significant improvements in obstacle avoidance capabilities. The integration of these methodologies is aimed at advancing real-time performance and contributing to the competitive edge of the autonomous vehicle
    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Smart Microsystems Lab, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, US
      year: Aug23-Pr.
      description:
        - Engineered an autonomous robotic blimp with 4-thruster configuration, IMU, WiFi, and LoRa connectivity;
          developed microcontroller PCB and firmware with micro-ROS architecture to streamline algorithm development
          between low-level and high-level control systems
        - Modelled the dynamics of the blimp and developed a simulator to test the control algorithms in a virtual
          environment, enabling rapid prototyping and validation of control strategies before deployment on the physical
          system. This approach significantly reduced development time and improved the reliability of the control
          algorithms by allowing for extensive testing in a controlled environment
        - Modeled a non-linear strain sensor with considerable time dynamics using Time Delayed Neural
          Network(TDNN), to capture temporal features. Resulting in a model with a R2=0.98+, and a prediction frequency
          of over 2kHz
        - Designed an 8-pressure sensor breakout board with Altium Designer to interface with a pneumatic pressure
          setup to measure negative and positive gauge pressures


    - title: Embedded Systems Intern
      institution: Intrepid Control Systems, Troy, Michigan, US
      year: May2024 - Aug2024
      description:
        - Enhanced firmware of Zynq-based products by integrating IMU, DoIP, and GPS support using Xilinx SDK,
          resolving over 7+ firmware driver issues to enrich product functionality
        - Added gPTP support for 10Base T1S PHY and TC10 support for 100/1000 Base T1 Automotive Ethernet products,
          optimizing GPS signal reporting and enhancing system performance through the company's resource API
        - Took the initiative to automate network traffic testing on automotive Ethernet products using Ixia's network
         load module, reducing manual effort from 120 to 5 minutes and accelerating report generation

    - title: Student Technical Assistant
      institution: Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, US
      year: Nov2022 - May2023
      description:
        - Developed an application tailored specifically for carbon charge stripper data analysis, improving the efficiency
          of routine maintenance and research processes by automating work. As a result, time spent on data analysis
          was reduced by 60%, enhancing the productivity of the maintenance and research teams
        - Designed and constructed a high-pressure experimental apparatus capable of withstanding pressures up to 275
          psig for the high-power trajectory department to aid in development of next-generation technology for linear
          accelerators
